# Interactive Web Application - INF 651 Final Project

## Overview

This project is an interactive web application that demonstrates various JavaScript concepts learned throughout this course. The application provides dynamic, JavaScript-driven interactivity to enhance the user experience through thoughtful design and functionality. It includes features like adding items to a shopping cart with real-time updates, form validation, and dynamically updating page content.

## Features

- **Interactive Shopping Cart**
  - Add items to the cart and see the total cost update automatically.

- **Checkout**
- Proceed to a checkout section with the option to review the cart, enter shipping details, and calculate total prices.
  
- **Real-Time Form Validation**
  - Validate form fields such as email and phone number upon user input.
  
- **Dynamic Content**
  - Reveal and hide content or sections based on user actions (e.g., click to reveal more information).

## Pages

1. **Home Page:**
   - Personalized welcome message and an interactive introduction to the application.

2. **About Page:**
   - Dynamic content that reveals sections upon user interaction.

3. **Service Page:**
   - Provide services such as Smartphone Repairs, Device Customization, Accessories Sale, and Trade-In Offers with a Request Service Form below.
  
4. **Contact Page:**
   - Real-time form validation for contact details submission, such as email and phone number.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout for a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: Handles interactivity, DOM manipulation, event handling, and logic.

## JavaScript Concepts Implemented

- **Event Listeners**: Used for triggering interactivity (e.g., button clicks, form submissions).
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically updating page content, such as adding/removing items from the shopping cart.
- **Conditional Logic**: Used for dynamic behavior (e.g., showing/hiding content, validating forms).
- **Loops and Functions**: To iterate over product lists and handle repetitive tasks efficiently.
- **Data Handling**: Storing and processing data using arrays.
